The GitSync Tool Suite is designed for educators, students, and developers who want to bring clarity and structure to their Git workflow. It automates versioning and syncing based on a clear "Testing" vs. "Stable" cycle, abstracting away complex branching strategies into simple, memorable commands.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Semantic Workflow**

  Built-in checks to prevent accidental pushes to diverged branches.

- **Automated Installer**  
  A one-line command to set up the entire suite, including all dependencies.
